## Description
In this project, we were trying to understand which factors have an important influence on the average rate of restaurants on TripAdvisor.
The scope of our analysis:
- Country : France
- Factors chosen : region, price range, diet options (vegetarian, vegan and gluten free), type of cuisines, open days per week, number of reviews and reservation feature
- Types of cuisine : French, Italian, Chinese, Japanese & Fastfood


## Dataset 
We use a dataset found on Kaggle : [TripAdvisor European restaurants](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/tripadvisor-european-restaurants)


## Workflow
Our project can be divided into different phases  :

**Phase 1** : Looking for a dataset & a topic
- Research on multiple open data website : Kaggle, Google dataset search, UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Look for a dataset with interesting topic
- Get validated by the Lead Teacher
- Create the plan for our presentation (introduction, analysis at a macro level, analysis at a more detailed level,...)
- Split the taskload between team members

**Phase 2** : Cleaning the dataset

Our dataset is quite large with more than 1 million rows.
We decided to limit our scope of analysis to restaurants in France and chose some of the features that we think can have a big impact on the rate.

**Phase 3** : Looking for correlation between our target variable (average rate) and the other variables for a macro analysis --> heat map

**Phase 4** : Analysis at a more detailed level with different visualizations for each explicative variable & providing insight

**Phase 5** : Working on our Github repository and presentation slides
